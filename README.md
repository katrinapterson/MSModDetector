# MSModDetector
This repository calculates mass shifts and infers post-translational modfication (PTM) patterns in individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) data.
I2MS is a top-down mass spectrometry (MS) approach that generates true mass spectra without the need to infer charge states.
The algorithm first detects and quantifies mass shifts for a protein of interest and subsequently infers potential PTM patterns using linear programming.
